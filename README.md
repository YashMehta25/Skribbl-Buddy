This repository contains code files for a ML project done by Yash Mehta and Tarshit Sehgal wherein a Feed-Forward Neural Network is trained to guess hand-drawn images over a basket of 50 categories. There are two code files in this repository -
1. Converts the hand drawn image by a user into pixel representation and then into an image vector
2. Trains the required Neural Network from scratch
